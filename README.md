# JS13K 2021 - Distant Friends

An entry for js13kgames 2021.

It has been a long time since you last saw your friends. You board your rocket and fly back into Ceres... will you be able to gather the gang back together?

Race across the galaxy, become an asteroid miner, and fish legendary creatures from deep space as you hop from planet to planet, following the lives of your now distant friends.

Desktop: Use the arrow keys to control the ship, space to fire rockets, and Enter to change waypoint.

Mobile: Tap on the screen areas to control the ship, fire rockets, and change waypoint.
